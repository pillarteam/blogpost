## Cryptocurrency primer

### Tulip mania or Internet 3.0 ?
On Sunday January 2018 the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies reached $800 billion. To put this gargantuan number into perspective, it is equivalent to about 7 times the US international reserve assets, the GDP of the Netherlands or the market capitalization of Apple Inc. at the time. A more interesting metric however, is that this milestone was hit just days after the total cryptocurrencies market capitalization reach $700 billion.
The largest crypto-asset by market capitalization, the oldest continuously existing cryptocurrency, and a major speculative force, Bitcoin, reached a staggering $20,000 unit price and its market capitalization broke the $300 billion threshold in December 2017. Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller drew a parallel between the phenomenon driving this upwards trend and the frenzy that characterized the exponential increase in tulip flower price in 1640s Holland, coined “tulip mania”. At the time this article was written, a few months after the peak described above, the hype has somewhat faded
Value investing prodigy Warren Buffett emphatically expressed his disinterest in cryptocurrencies. Bill Gates described his concern with the criminal risks associated with an unregulated currency while Steve “Woz” Wozniak described blockchain as the next major IT revolution. Countless other authorities in technology, finance and law have emitted opinions, positive or negative, on the topic spurring a truly global and on-going debate on the true nature of these assets and blockchain technology.

The true nature these financial assets is still up in the air – currencies that can be conveniently used to purchase goods, commodities or other kinds of monetary asset? This question extends beyond Bitcoin and even beyond other cryptocurrencies – all blockchain projects are not created equal - to decentralized applications using blockchain technology. As this public statement by the SEC shows, there is an abundance of unanswered questions about cryptocurrencies. While the SEC is concerned with legal semantics and attempts to position these new assets within the existing financial system and capital markets, we are concerned with the economic, psychological technological fundamentals of cryptocurrency.

### Game theory
Is this technology truly novel? Is it economically viable? Does it scale? When Satoshi Nakamoto wrote his primer on Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, he did not only suggest a new way of storing assets and conducting financial transactions, he also initiated an large scale Game theory experiment. This text: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout” for banks is embedded in the coinbase of the first Bitcoin block – mined by Satoshi himself. Maybe an eternal, immutable reference to the blood relative of this newly imagined financial system: American capitalism. The horse carriage to Bitcoin’s Tesla, the keypunch to Bitcoin’s multi-core, flash memory high definition laptop. Satoshi published this paper and pushed the core Bitcoin code in the eye of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis storm, a systemic failure of the world banking system. Although the crisis was caused by a bubble of a mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations offering interest rates and risk ratings that didn’t match the underlying assets’ (pools of mortgages) actual risk profile, Satoshi saw in it a trust breach caused by a centralized financial system. Assuming that creating a system that forces decentralization might solve the problem, Satoshi wrote the core Bitcoin code so that anyone – albeit with some understanding of computer hardware and proficiency in C++ (these requirements would become exponentially restricting) could do work to verify transactions done by users of the network and get Bitcoin in exchange. Ironically, Bitcoin has risen to “bubbly” heights in a very speculative and capitalist fashion reminiscent in its rate of the mortgage crisis, but not in volume. Bitcoin behaves less like a currency and more like a highly speculative asset. A specialized industry has grown substantially to take advantage of mining: mining conglomerates that compete on producing Application-specific integrated circuit chips (ASIC), to mine Bitcoin more efficiently.  Five Chinese-based mining companies (AntPool, ViaBTC, F2Pool, BTC.TOP and BTC.com) control more than 51% of the network (hashrate), meaning that they could cooperate and take the network down or allow malicious actors to operate in the network.

## Volatility and stablecoins

### Supply-side regulation
This large-scale social experiment has shown that the value of Bitcoin, driven only by the laws of supply and demand, is too volatile to be used as a currency without a sophisticated supply-regulating entity. There are two reactions to volatility: speculation and fear. The volatility of cryptocurrencies attracts buyers because of the potential gain that can be drawn from their speculative value, and scares away the bearish people who might care about their intrinsic value (fundamentals). Stablecoins have the decentralized properties of normal cryptocurrencies with much less volatility. They can be traded (arbitrage, hedge and speculative) but most importantly they allow entrepreneurs to create tangible value using blockchain or other decentralization mechanisms.
In light of the latter observation, a new term has gained a lot of momentum among cryptocurrency enthusiasts: stablecoins. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency with an embedded system to stabilize its absolute or relative value. There are many ways to control the value of an asset. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum and most “cryptoassets” have a set supply based on linear, logarithmic, polynomial or exponential increments to the computational load required to mine coins over time. Our team believes that a different approach on the supply strategy could solve the volatility problem of cryptocurrencies, and thus allow the proliferation of the cryptographic and digital financial system for functional as opposed to speculative reasons. Currently, the US dollar is a free-floating currency (just like the pound sterling, the Japanese yen, the Swiss Franc, the Indian rupee, among others), and as such it is also subject to the laws of supply and demand. So why doesn’t it fluctuate as much as Bitcoin? The Federal Reserve System in the United States is the central banking system of the U.S. and we believe that it ironically holds the answer to decentralized software-based banking. The institution is responsible for stabilizing prices, moderating long-term interest rates, supervising, regulating banks and maintaining the stability of the financial system among other things. We were inspired by Basis’ paper and by the role of the Federal Reserve to develop Pillar, a Tendermint/LotionJS library for developers with some cryptocurrency enthusiasm tainted by skepticism related to the volatility of unregulated “crypto-assets”, and a stand-alone wallet to illustrate a final product that uses our library.

### Stabilizing algorithms
The implementation utilizes economic principles and debt financing concepts. Pillar allows you to peg your cryptocurrency to any desired asset, it could a basket of currencies, a CPI or even a normalized Big Mac Index. On top of traditional transactions – sell, buy using tokens, our library implements three main algorithms to regulate supply and demand. The idea is to maintain price equilibrium by regulating the supply and controlling the demand with debt financing (digitial bonds). The oracle system runs every X blocks and estimates what the price of the asset is (in units of the asset itself). If the result is below one, the price is below the real value of the asset and thus we need to increase the price, and thus decrease the supply. To do that, the software sells bonds to the users in exchange for a pre-computed fraction of a token. The bond will redeem one token to the user at an arbitrary time. When the price is too high, and we need to increase the supply, the algorithm redeems bonds in the order in which they were sold. If the entire bond queue was redeemed, and the supply still needs to be increased, the marginal amount is airdropped to token owners on a pro-rata basis.



## Technical implementation :

Our implementation is using LotionJS with our library written in Node. The validators keep track of the users requests and add it to the Tendermint blockchain.

We also developed a simple wallet which integrate our library and allow users to vote or do transactions. The desktop application has been developed using :
* LotionJS : handle the communication with the Tendermint blockchain
* Electron : a framework to build desktop application using web technology
* ReactJS/SemanticUI : To build a dynamic interface
* Pillar lib : a lotionJS extension which handle our stablecoin logic

## Next Steps

We will roll out our project within the Lotion/Coin module and will be seeking feedback from developers – QA, testing. We want to incentivize the use of our library in original projects and as such make ourselves available to help.
We want to implement more oracle system algorithms such as web scraping of multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. Additional customization of the airdrop, bond issuance and transaction algorithms in the backend might be useful to give more freedom to the developers and we would love to hear your thoughts on which options and parameters would be useful along with a use case example. An internal idea we have is to incorporate a more elaborate bond pricing system and eventual multiple term interest rates to allow for a less disruptive price regulation.
Based on developer feedback, we might work on a stand-alone npm module with a more robust and comprehensive implementation. We are also interested in performance at scale and as such would also consider writing a Go version of our algorithms in collaboration with the LotionJS, Tendermint and Cosmos developers.
